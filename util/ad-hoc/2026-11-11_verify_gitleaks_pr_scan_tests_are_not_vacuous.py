"""Negative control for the pull-request Gitleaks scan: prove the tests/test_gitleaks_pr_scan.py cases can FAIL.

Project: juniper-data-client
Sub-Project: ad-hoc tooling
Author: Paul Calnon
Created: 2026-11-11
Status: ad-hoc — investigation (negative control for the port of juniper-data#530; ruling 10 in section 8 of juniper-ml's notes/JUNIPER_2026-11-06_JUNIPER-ECOSYSTEM_CURSOR-FLOOD-4-DISPOSITION.md)
Retire when: the pull-request scan steps in ci.yml are replaced or removed.
Related: .github/workflows/ci.yml ("Install Gitleaks (pull request)", "Run Gitleaks over the pull request"),
         tests/test_gitleaks_pr_scan.py, util/ad-hoc/2026-11-11_reproduce_gitleaks_pr_commit_window.py

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
A test that passes against both the fixed and the broken workflow pins nothing. Each mutation below undoes one
property by an exact-match edit, runs the tests that must go red and the tests that must stay green, each test in a
pytest process of its own, then restores the file and proves the restore by SHA-256. Most mutations edit ci.yml.
One edits the test file's own mark, and one adds a `.gitleaks.toml` that loads no rule to the repository root,
which the hermetic repositories then carry.

The scan step's shell is juniper-data's, so the first fourteen mutations are juniper-data's own
(util/ad-hoc/2026-11-08_verify_gitleaks_pr_scan_tests_are_not_vacuous.py there). The rest undo what this
repository's port adds or pins differently: the engine version on the action step, the self-test step and its
required real-engine run, the unit lane's unfiltered `pytest tests/`, the events the workflow runs on, and each
remaining assertion of the static cases. Thirteen of those are on what keeps a failure blocking: `continue-on-error`
on the job, on the install or on the scan, a job-level `if`, the job's name (a required check), the self-test's
whole command, the whole digest line, the report upload (its `if: always()`, its path, its place after the scan),
and the anchor of the `git` filter's `sed` expression.

The real-engine cases need a gitleaks 8.24.3 binary: set GITLEAKS_BIN. GITLEAKS_PARITY_REQUIRED=1 is forced, so a
missing binary turns the baseline red instead of skipping (a skip would score as a pass).

Run from the repo root, with an interpreter that has the `[test]` extra (pytest, pytest-timeout, PyYAML)::

    GITLEAKS_BIN=<gitleaks 8.24.3> python util/ad-hoc/2026-11-11_verify_gitleaks_pr_scan_tests_are_not_vacuous.py --basetemp <dir> --backup <dir> [--workers 4] [--json <file>]

It edits ci.yml in place, so run nothing else that reads the workflow while it runs, and pass --backup when the
tree is uncommitted: the script restores each file in a `finally`, which an interrupt (SIGINT) runs and a kill does
not. With --backup it keeps a pristine copy of every file it is about to mutate, and it refuses to start when a
copy left by an earlier run differs from the file, which is what a run killed mid-mutation leaves behind.

Exit 0 when the baseline is green, every mutation is caught by every test listed for it, no listed survivor goes
red, and every restore is exact; exit 1 otherwise.
