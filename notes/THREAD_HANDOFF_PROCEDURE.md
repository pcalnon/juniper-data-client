# Thread Handoff Procedure

**Purpose**: Preserve context fidelity during long-running Amp sessions by proactively handing off to a new thread before context compaction degrades output quality.

## Why Handoff Over Compaction

Thread compaction summarizes prior context to free token capacity. This introduces **information loss** — subtle details about decisions made, edge cases discovered, partial progress, and the reasoning behind specific implementation choices get compressed or dropped. For work on juniper-data-client (e.g., client API changes, retry/error handling refactors, cross-consumer compatibility work), this degradation can cause:

- Repeated mistakes the thread already resolved
- Inconsistent code style mid-task
- Loss of discovered constraints or gotchas
- Re-reading files that were already understood

A **proactive handoff** transfers a curated, high-signal summary to a fresh thread with full context capacity, preserving the critical information while discarding the noise.

## When to Initiate a Handoff

Trigger a handoff when **any** of the following conditions are met:

| Condition                   | Indicator                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Context saturation**      | Thread has performed 15+ tool calls or edited 5+ files                                                                      |
| **Phase boundary**          | A logical phase of work is complete (e.g., planning done → implementation starting; implementation done → testing starting) |
| **Degraded recall**         | The agent re-reads a file it already read, or asks a question it already resolved                                           |
| **Multi-module transition** | Moving from one major component to another (e.g., `client.py` → `exceptions.py` → `tests/`)                                 |
| **User request**            | User says "hand off", "new thread", "continue in a fresh thread", or similar                                                |

**Do NOT handoff** when:

- The task is nearly complete (< 2 remaining steps)
- The current thread is still sharp and producing correct output
- The work is tightly coupled and splitting would lose critical in-flight state

## Handoff Protocol

### Step 1: Checkpoint Current State

Before initiating the handoff, mentally inventory:

1. **What was the original task?** (user's request, verbatim or paraphrased)
2. **What has been completed?** (files created, files edited, tests passed/failed)
3. **What remains?** (specific next steps, not vague summaries)
4. **What was discovered?** (gotchas, constraints, decisions, rejected approaches)
5. **What files are in play?** (paths of files read, modified, or relevant)

### Step 2: Compose the Handoff Goal

Write a **concise, actionable** goal for the new thread. Structure it as:

```bash
Continue [TASK DESCRIPTION].

Completed so far:
- [Concrete item 1]
- [Concrete item 2]

Remaining work:
- [Specific next step 1]
- [Specific next step 2]

Key context:
- [Important discovery or constraint]
- [File X was modified to do Y]
- [Approach Z was rejected because...]
```

**Rules for the goal**:

- **Be specific**: "Add retry logic to `JuniperDataClient.download_artifact_npz()`" not "finish the retry work"
- **Include file paths**: The new thread doesn't know what you've been looking at
- **State decisions made**: So the new thread doesn't re-litigate them
- **Mention test status**: If tests were run, state pass/fail counts
- **Keep it under ~500 words**: Dense signal, no filler

### Step 3: Execute the Handoff

Present the composed handoff goal to the user and recommend starting a new thread with it as the initial prompt. If the `handoff()` tool is available:

```bash
handoff(
    goal="<composed goal from Step 2>",
    follow=true
)
```

- Set `follow=true` when the current thread should stop and work continues in the new thread (the common case).
- Set `follow=false` only if the current thread has independent remaining work (rare).

## Handoff Goal Templates

### Template: Implementation In Progress

```bash
Continue implementing [FEATURE] in juniper-data-client.

Completed:
- Modified [file1] with [description]
- Added tests in [test_file] (X/Y passing)

Remaining:
- Implement [specific method/behavior]
- Add tests for [specific behavior]
- Update pyproject.toml if needed

Key context:
- Using [pattern/approach] because [reason]
- [File X] has a constraint: [detail]
- Run tests with: pytest tests/ -v
- Type check: mypy juniper_data_client --strict
```

### Template: Debugging Session

```bash
Continue debugging [ISSUE DESCRIPTION] in juniper-data-client.

Findings so far:
- Root cause is likely in [file:line] because [evidence]
- Ruled out: [rejected hypothesis 1], [rejected hypothesis 2]
- Reproduced with: [command or test]

Next steps:
- Verify hypothesis by [specific action]
- Apply fix in [file]
- Run [specific test] to confirm

Key context:
- The bug manifests as [symptom]
- Related code path: [file1] → [file2]
- Consumers affected: [JuniperCascor/JuniperCanopy/both]
```

### Template: Client API / Cross-Consumer Work

```bash
Continue [CLIENT API TASK] in juniper-data-client.

Completed:
- Modified juniper_data_client/client.py: [description]
- Updated juniper_data_client/exceptions.py if needed
- Updated __init__.py exports if needed

Remaining:
- Implement [specific method or behavior change]
- Add/update unit tests in tests/
- Verify backward compatibility with consumers (JuniperCascor, JuniperCanopy)

Key context:
- Public API: JuniperDataClient class in client.py
- Exceptions: JuniperDataError hierarchy in exceptions.py
- Data contract: NPZ with keys X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, X_full, y_full (float32)
- Default service URL: http://localhost:8100
- Run tests: pytest tests/ -v
- Run with coverage: pytest tests/ --cov=juniper_data_client --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=80
```

## Best Practices

1. **Handoff early, not late** — A handoff at 70% context usage is better than compaction at 95%
2. **One handoff per phase boundary** — Don't chain 5 handoffs for one task; batch related work
3. **Include the verification command** — Always tell the new thread how to check its work (`pytest`, `mypy --strict`, etc.)
4. **Reference CLAUDE.md** — The new thread will read it automatically, but call out any project-specific conventions relevant to the remaining work
5. **Don't duplicate CLAUDE.md content** — The new thread already has it; only include task-specific context
6. **State the git status** — If files are staged, modified, or if a branch is in use, mention it

## Integration with Project Workflow

This procedure complements the existing development workflow in CLAUDE.md. When a thread handoff occurs during feature development:

- The new thread should verify it can run tests before making changes
- The new thread should re-read any file it plans to edit (fresh context, no assumptions)
- Since this is a shared library, always note which consumers may be affected by changes
