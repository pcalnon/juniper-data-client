# Description:
#    Pins [project].version in pyproject.toml to juniper_data_client.__version__
#    (defect register APD-ECO-005). The two are maintained by hand in separate
#    files and nothing checked that they agree.

"""The pyproject/dunder version-lockstep gate (defect register ``APD-ECO-005``).

``[project].version`` and ``juniper_data_client.__version__`` are two hand-maintained
literals in two files. Nothing checked that they agree, and the failure is silent in
the direction that matters: the static release path bumps ``pyproject.toml``, so a
wheel ships whose ``__version__`` lies about what it is. A consumer pinning on the
dunder, logging it, or reporting it in a bug then reports the wrong version.

This is not hypothetical in this ecosystem:

* ``juniper-service-core`` 0.5.0 shipped with a stale dunder and went **five days**
  unnoticed, because no gate existed -- the incident that motivated the meta-repo's
  ``VersionDunderLockstepTest``.
* This very package drifted once already: ``APD-CCLIENT-F01`` in the register records
  ``__version__`` left at ``0.4.0`` while the package shipped ``0.5.x``/``0.6.x``. It
  was fixed, but the *guard* was never added, so nothing prevents a recurrence.

The mechanism exists one level up -- ``juniper-ml``'s
``tests/test_release_train_registry.py::VersionDunderLockstepTest`` -- but it scans
only packages **in that repository**. The standalone client repos live outside its
reach, which is precisely why the drift happened here and not there.

Deliberately added while the two literals **agree**. That is when a guard is worth
adding: a convention with no test has already drifted somewhere nobody has looked.
